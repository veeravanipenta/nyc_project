# **NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction**

This project aims to predict the duration of NYC taxi trips using machine learning models. The dataset used includes various features such as pickup and drop-off locations, times, and other contextual information related to the trips. The project includes different predictive models, data visualizations, and interactive applications for exploring and analyzing the data.

## **Project Files**:

### **`main.py`**:
The main.py file Python script that handles the Streamlit web application for interaction with the models.

### **`NYC_Taxi_Trip_Duration_Actual.twb`**:
A Tableau workbook for visualizing the NYC taxi trip data. It contains interactive dashboards and graphs for analyzing trip durations, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the data.

### **`Rand_frst_model.pkl`**:
A trained **Random Forest** model used for predicting trip durations. It is an ensemble model that captures non-linear relationships between features.

### **`decision_tree_model.pkl`**:
A trained **Decision Tree** model used for predicting trip durations based on decision rules derived from the features of the dataset.

### **`lg_model.pkl`**:
A trained **Logistic Regression** model used for predicting trip durations. This model is a linear model and evaluates the relationship between features and the duration of trips.

### **`light_gbm_model.pkl`**:
A trained **LightGBM** model used for predicting trip durations. This gradient boosting model is optimized for speed and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### **`nyc_taxi_trip_duration.ipynb`**:
A **Jupyter notebook** for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the NYC taxi trip dataset. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
